I'm on a plane to Madrid.

It's early, I haven't slept much â€“ about five hours.

I can sense the engine, trembling under my feet.

I can touch the heat of the sun outside my window, reaching me through the plastic glass.

I have my blind down, but I can see a fine line of light at the bottom, right where the blind stops.

The music I just put on fills my ears with quietness and calm.

It's ok.

I feel ok.

I just watched an episode of _Pretty Little Liars_. Spoiler alert: things are getting interesting. Aria's in it for the long run.

My partner sits right beside me, watching the second season of _Fargo_. I skipped on that one; couldn't be bothered. One season was enough. It was good, but the sort of dish you want to eat only once every six or nine months. Not regularly.

I'm writing on a dark grey screen, using markdown on MacDown. It's soothing. No distractions. No formatting issues. No, 'does this typefont work better than this other typefont?'. Just a dark screen, white letters. It's interesting how it pumps up creativity, this no nonsense.

I'm reading a book on Essentialism. It proposes that we should invest more time on looking after ourselves, our body and minds, and distilling what's important and what isn't. When someone suggests an opportunity, your answer should either be "Hell, yeah!" or "No". If you're not excited about it, it should be a no. If you're just saying yes but it feels a bit 'meh', it should really be a no. Saying no is fucking hard though. I really struggle with that. I think most people do.

My thoughts are scattered, like scrambled eggs in the morning, healthy but yummy. You can put as much stuff as you want in them, be creative, spinach, mushrooms, bacon, olives, onions, what-have-you. Or whatever you have in the fridge. Just pop it in there. Give it a couple of swirls. Serve on a plate. Eat it.

I think I'll be enjoying this little writing project. Later I can retouch, refine and perfect. Not now though. Not it's time to write freely, no pressure, no expectations, no goals other than just getting the thing done every day.

Just write.

Every day.
