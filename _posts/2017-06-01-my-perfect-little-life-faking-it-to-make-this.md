I just shut my Instagram app. I spent about 5 to 10 minutes on there. I am not an "instagramer" by nature, but two days ago I figured it'd be the easiest way to share my nice pictures with the rest of the world. Not *all* the pictures, though. Just the good ones. I'm just hoping that's exactly what everyone else is doing.

See, I spent five minutes on the thing and I'm already feeling slightly less happy. Or maybe a little bit more depressed. I'm already comparing myself to others. This girl just went to this place with her partner, look how happy they are! That other girl looks amazing in her bikini. This guys is a fabulous painter, photographer and musician. Yes, all that talent in just one person. You'd think most people don't have any problems these days. Man, everyone seems joyful and beautiful and ecstatic to be living every single moment of their lives.

And here I am, still in the office because I'm waiting for everyone else to finish their commute home so that I can actually breathe and move my arms while on the tube. It's a relatively beautiful day outside, but I don't feel like going out for a walk because my bag is too heavy – apparently I do this thing where I put too much stuff in it, and then I can't carry it around but I can't, for the life of me, get rid of anything that's inside either. Also, it's all shops in Covent Garden, and tourists, and people. Did I mention how much I dislike people?

But, see, I could sell it to you. Let's start with my outfit today: it's a super nice one, I really made the effort this morning. White, fluffy skirt and a navy t-shirt with matching canvas shoes – I *know*, I take after my mom in so many ways, including this one. I topped it off with a salmon pink cardigan to sweeten it up even further, and my hair is soft and wavy because I decided not to blow-dry it this morning, and this is what it does when you leave it to its own devices. Let me continue. This is fun.

I'm sitting on a bean bag. In the office *library*. Wait, there's more: we have books. For free. And it's quiet and peaceful in here. I even brought my cup of tea with me. With almond milk, because we have a huge array of non-dairy options in the office fridge. I also have a Macbook Pro on my lap, because that's how we roll here. I can sense your eyes are turning a subtle shade of green. Give me another two paragraphs and you'll be hating me.

I could go on and on about how cool working at my startup company is, but – really –, what you care about is my love life. I know it, you know it. Let's get it over with. I'm in a loving relationship of two years. We laugh every single day, we tell each other we love each other *constantly*, and we hardly ever argue. We cycle together, we watch TV shows and documentaries together, we – of course – travel together, every year we go on a cool summer trip. We share our love for films, deep conversation and jazz music. We adore books so much that we get lost in bookstores, and we can stay in there for hours. Wait, wait, wait. We also fell in love almost instantly. It was perfect from the beginning: we started dating seriously from day one, and we moved in together after three months. We even have a droopy eyelid, on the same eye. I mean, ain't that a beautiful coincidence?

But a description of my fabulous life wouldn't kill you unless I included the best thing of all: I live in *London*. In a one-bedroom apartment. Londoners will know how much of an achievement it is to both find the perfect place and be able to pay for it. And *of course* our place is absolutely perfect. Ample, airy, minimalistic and warm in the winter months. We turned our heating off a couple of months ago.

Don't you want to kill me right now? Well, the truth is, I don't want to kill *you*, so I'll be honest: it's all bullshit. I mean, it's all kind of true. None of that was a lie. I have a great relationship with an awesome man, I work at a fantastic company and my flat is pretty damn nice. But all that is far, far, very far from perfect. The few arguments we have are intense. My salary is not impressive. And I live next to a railway station, for God's sake.

But, hey, doing this exercise of "selling my life" made me realise it's actually quite good. For real. Give this thing a go. Fake it 'till you make. You don't need to share it with the rest of the world, though. That'd be mean.
