Writing when you don't want to write. Like today. Tonight. I don't want to write tonight, but I skipped yesterday, and the day before yesterday, and so I now *have* to write something before it's too late and I find myself having a backlog of four texts. Let's keep it at three. Maybe I can do a couple tomorrow, and then another two on Friday. That would solve the problem. I'd be back to square one. That's doable.

I didn't write yesterday, or the day before, because I have been busy spending time with my partner's family, watching movies by Billy Wilder and eating a lot. I travelled back yesterday but was too busy watching *The Imitation Game*, which I had to see before I go visit Bletchley Park on Saturday. I know, I'm whining. Let her whine.

I had a fine day today, the sort that flies by and it's suddenly 5pm and you don't know what bit you. I like those days, the busy ones. They make me happy.

I feel like I ramble a lot on here lately, which I guess is fine. I mean, it's kind of my diary/journal/personal blog/whatever, and no one reads it anyway. Except for you. Thanks for reading, I appreciate it. If I don't know you, please know that I'd love to. Say hello. Write me an e-mail. I honestly hope you're enjoying my ramblings.

I think I'm going to leave it here today, because my eyelids are closing and I still need to pick a workout for tomorrow, brush my teeth and do some reading. And it's 23:10. Time's up. Good night, and good luck.
