It took me over twenty days of my precious life to finish this book. During those twenty days - and then some -, people would ask me: 'oh, so what are you reading now?' And I would say, '_May we be forgiven_, by AM Homes. Not sure I'm going to forgive her.' People found it funny. I meant it as a joke, but I was being serious. I have no regrets though, I'm happy that I read this. I'm glad that, finally, interesting, thought-provoking, not-wow-not-meh-not-ugh books are crawling back to my shelves. Makes my reading life a lot more exciting.


>"Was this the big one or was this the small tremor, the warning? Does it get better - does the sensation of being in a dream underwater go away?" 


I will not even try to summarize _May we be forgiven_, it would take me about 1000 words just to recount the main stuff that happen in this novel. It is one of the most eventful books I've read, ever. In the first five pages (roughly), the main protagonist, Harry, cheats on his wife, Claire, with his brother's wife, Jane. While they are on the early stages of what comes across as an incredibly rushed affair, his brother, George, goes crazy and causes a car accident and kills a family. Then George is put in the hospital (or was it a sanatorium?) while they all wait for the trial, but at some point he escapes and goes back home and finds Harry (so, the main protagonist) in bed with Jane. And then he kills her. And then there are 475 pages left to go. The story includes Harry's several sexual affairs, him taking care of children and pets, him teaching and then losing his teaching job. They also organize a Bar and Bat Mitzvah in Africa, and Harry adopts a third child. Oh, and I forgot about the Men Scouts Camp for irremediable criminals. There's also a lot of rambling about Nixon and there's some incident with a tampon not being inserted properly. No kidding. 


So where does all this leave me, the reader?


>“Given the circumstances, I think the rabbi did a very good job. What did you think?”
“It's my policy not to review funerals.” 


During the first 100 pages I was thrilled. _May we forgiven_ is a very dark comedy and I would laugh really hard now and then. I also was excited about the pace, it never got boring. There was always more and more. Then, after 200 pages, I started to become bored with so much craziness. By page 350 I considered quitting, but by then I was already too invested in the story, and I have serious problems when it comes to quitting books anyway. After hitting page 400, and only 80 pages away from the ending, all I could think about was finishing the book and moving on.


I'm glad I don't rate the books I read because if this was some kid's piece of homework I would pass it on to another colleague for them to grade. AM Homes is undeniably a good writer with a wry sense of humour and a fantastic ability to dig into the human soul. I'm aware that most of the things I could criticise about this book are probably intentionally that way. However, this doesn't mean we are on the same wavelength. I was really recommending this book to everyone I came across when I first started it; by the time I was done with it, I had changed my mind.


To begin with, there's just too much going on, and it gets to a point when it borders on a strange sort of surrealism. No matter how many horrible things happen to the characters, the effects are minimal. They cry here and there, but I felt there was not enough emotion in their responses. These people - all of them - are numb robots, and I reject the idea that real human beings are that way. And then there's the final sense of redemption, that happy ever after that not even Snowhite and her Prince Charming were able to get. I also didn't understand why so many people hated Harry and placed him and George (a crazy murderer) under the same light? I mean, in my book, sleeping with a married woman and killing her are not exactly the same thing.


>“A guy rubbed against me,” I say. “But I think he was just trying to get by. He rubbed me, then said sorry. It was the ‘sorry’ that made me uncomfortable. The rub was kind of interesting, but when he apologized I felt like a creep because I actually liked it.” 


I have mixed feelings about _May we be forgiven_, but that's ok. That's good. That's what keeps both reading and writing experiences alive and going. Keep doing your thing, AM Homes, and I'll do mine. And who knows? We might meet again. Sometime.
