I love going to the library. I love going to _my_ library. See, there’s this shelf, in my library, where all the classics are stored. Jane Austen and Mr. Dickens are there, and so is Monsieur Proust. But here’s the thing about this shelf: Jean Rhys, Anaïs Nin and Françoise Sagan are there, too. So is Patrick Hamilton. And this is really cool, because I’m discovering many, many good ‘old’ authors thanks to this shelf.


So I find this big book by someone named Patrick Hamilton, and I don’t know who he is, but there’s a love story in it so I’m suddenly interested. And then I discover they’re three volumes in one, which is a little scary, but it’s from the library so if I don’t like it I can just return unread and that’s that. So I just take it home with me. And thus my 20-days journey with _Twenty Thousand Streets under the Sky_ begins.


**_The Midnight Bell_**


>“Though it had no wide reputation, all manner of people frequented 'The Midnight Bell.' This was in its nature, of course, since it is notorious that all manner of people frequent all manner of public-houses - which in this respect resemble railway stations and mad-houses.” 


The first novel centres on the life and woes of Bob, the waiter at The Midnight Bell. The Midnight Bell is a pub located in Euston Road, and this is London in the early XX century. It’s cold and grey, and a little bit dodgy. And Bob, a former sailor, spends his days working his a** off at the bar, serving all sorts of customers and saving as much money as he can manage to take to the bank every week. On Thursdays he has a day-off and takes himself for a nice meal and some time at the pictures. He’s attractive and kind but has no girl, mainly because he knows it would be too easy for him to get one. Instead, he dreams about becoming a writer and writing a novel some day. He spends his money on books and magazines and tries to learn as much as possible from them. But one day he meets his ultimate undoing: Jenny. He meets Jenny, a prostitute who visits The Midnight Bell for a drink, and her beauty and apparent fragility captivate him. He gives Jenny money straight away so that she can buy herself some food, and then looks for her all over London until he finds  and manages to start a strange relationship.


>“Only at dawn should a man awake from excess - at dawn agleam with red and sorrowful resolve.” 


Bob’s gradual downfall is painful to read because we all know how it’s going to end. Beautiful Jenny quickly realizes he has feelings for her – even before he realizes it himself - and takes advantage of the situation to the point of bringing him down to bankruptcy and alcoholism.


>“If he knew anything of her habits, she was certain to be somewhere about. He was not looking for her. He was submitting himself to the possibility of encounter.” 


While it was painful to watch, I enjoyed the way Bob was portrayed, and the slow pace in which he develops feelings for the pretty survivor of the streets. His contradicting thoughts, his moments of epiphany when he admits to himself that he’s fallen irremediably in love with her even though he can’t understand exactly way, and the way in which he tries to convince himself that this is the last time he’s going to give Jenny a chance were brilliantly described.


A novel with hardly any other characters besides Bob and Jenny – and a couple of extras here and there - The Midnight Bell, insightful and full of emotional intelligence, is probably my favourite of the three. Hamilton demonstrates his knowledge on human behaviour and the most natural instincts, and, at the same time, dedicates a most melancholy song to the city of London, grey and drowning in the tears of its inhabitants.


**_The Siege of Pleasure_**


_The Siege of Pleasure_, the second book in the _Twenty thousand streets under the Sky_ trilogy, revolves around Jenny, who in the first book seduces bartender Bob, and how she ended up becoming a prostitute. The story remounts to three years before Bob’s timeline, and begins with Jenny being just about eighteen years old.

                      

>"Jenny Maple, a girl of the West End streets, was walking in the vicinity of Shaftesbury Avenue, Piccadilly Circus, and Great Windmill Street at about eleven o’clock one night, when she became aware that she had attracted the glances of a seedy, furtive little man wearing white silk muffler and a soft hat"


_The Siege of Pleasure_ is probably the least favoured of the three by most readers, possibly because Jenny’s story reads slightly more fake, especially if one compares it to the other two novels. Jenny’s downfall begins one night when, right after work, she meets a female friend for tea and ends up partying all night with a couple of men she doesn’t know.


>"Here, for Jenny, was a quandary. She knew as little about alcoholic drinks as she did about public houses"


Young, innocent and proper, Jenny is also self-absorbed and vain, and when confronted by her peers about the fact that she's not drinking, pulls the trigger and has a glass of wine. The rest of the story is an expected and inevitable succession of calamities that eventually lead her to lose the job and end up working on the streets of London.


>"This was a new line of thought –not without allurement. Ought she to remain a servant girl?"


Told by a third person narrator that focuses on Jenny, _The Siege of Pleasure_ is a spinning story of self-destruction and goes well with the rest of the trilogy. The shortest of the three, its main character is not as well depicted as in the other books, and can at times read as a stereotype. It’s hard to like Jenny, and it’s hard to take her seriously but, at the same time, it’s hard not to pity her. I think it all comes down to the fact that she’s not as rounded as Bob or Ella and, even though her story is probably the most drastic and eventful of the three, Jenny remains plain and uninteresting.



**_The plains of cement_**


>“Here, then, stood ‘The Midnight Bell’, and anyone entering its Saloon Bar of an evening would have found its chief figure, a young woman of the name of Ella, in charge”


And finally, there’s the story of Ella, the barmaid who works with Bob at The Midnight Bell and who is helplessly in love with the male protagonist. Humble and plain, Ella is the opposite of Jenny, which is probably why Bob can’t find her attractive. In fact, few men do, so when a suitor for Ella comes up, the ground begins to shake. Much older and a bit ridiculous, Mr. Eccles finds in Ella a potential companion and openly pursues her, inviting her to the theatre and a nice dinner. Soon enough the barmaid finds herself entangled in a relationship she’s not quite sure about, and as the story progresses it gets messier and messier. Ella and Mr. Eccles' romance is complemented by two other big opportunities that could change Ella’s life.


>“Besides she had India and other things up her sleeve now. With those behind her, Mr. Eccles was not the same formidable man”


And yet, nothing happens. _The Plains of Cement_ is a melancholy account of a barmaid’s story of unrequited love and unfortunate happenings, and it touches a reader’s heart because of how easy it is to relate to Ella. Because we all have been Ella at some point: hopeful and miserable, doubtful and reassured, humble and arrogant, excited and upset.


The most humane and flawed of the three characters in _Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky_, Ella’s story in _The Plains of Cement_ is quiet and heartbreaking at the same time.


>“But about half-past ten that night, John, the new waiter at ‘The Midnight Bell’, coming up tired to bed after a hard day’s work in the job he had taken on, listened, and heard the barmaid weeping”
