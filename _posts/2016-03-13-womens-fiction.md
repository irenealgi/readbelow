Wikipedia defines _Women’s Fiction_ as an umbrella term for women-centered books that focus on women's life experiences and are marketed to female readers; it’s a category that includes many mainstream novels. So, to make this clearer, the women’s fiction category is for:

Women-centered books
About women’s life experience
Marketed at female readers

As specific as it may sound, in reality it’s far from it. In fact, it’s probably easier to define what is not _Women’s Fiction_. Of course, the following books are very often read and enjoyed by women:

- Adventure books such as _Treasure Island_
- Classic old thrillers 
- Anything by Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
- Travel novels like _Heart of Darkness_
- _The Lord of the Rings_ and _Game of Thrones_
- _The Chronicles of Narnia_ and _Harry Potter_
- Contemporary literary fiction books like _Freedom_, by Jonathan Franzen
- Indeterminable stuff like _Trainspotting_, by Irvine Welsh, and _Fight Club_ by Chuck Palahniuk
- _The world according to Garp_ or _In one person_, by John Irving
- _American Psycho_, by Bret Easton Ellis
- _The lord of the flies_, by William Golding

The following books, however, could be considered women’s fiction:

- _Jane Eyre_, by Charlotte Brönte, and _Pride and Prejudice_, by Jane Austen
- _Bridget Jones’ Diaries_, by Helen Fielding
- _Sushi for Beginners_, by Marian Keyes
- _PS I love you_, by Cecelia Ahern
- _The hours_, by Michael Cunningham and _Mrs Dalloway_, by Virginia Woolf
- _The Notebook_, by Nicholas Sparks
- _50 Shades of Grey_, by E.L. James
- _We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves_, by Karen Joy Fowler

As you can see from the list above, whatever falls under the category is just as heterogeneous as whatever falls outside the category. Reading it again, I can’t believe I put the experimental Mrs Dalloway next to gothic and dramatic _Jane Eyre_, sardonic _Pride and Prejudice_, funny and irreverent _Bridget Jones_, complex _The Hours_, cheesy and chaste _The Notebook_ and racy _50 Shades of Grey_ in the same sack. It makes no sense; welcome to discovery number one: 

>Women’s Fiction as a category makes no sense whatsoever. 

Which is why we have come up with a brilliant set of subcategories within the Women’s Fiction category:

- Chick-lit
- Romantic fiction
- Literary Fiction for women
- Commercial or General Fiction for women

Which takes me to discovery number 2:

>Women can read both general Literary or Commercial Fiction and Literary or Commercial Fiction for women; men can’t. 

If anything, the book industry is excluding men rather than women by setting a category that will/should not appeal to them. 

But it could also be interpreted as:

>Men read fiction targeted at people who can read; women read fiction targeted specifically at women.

Now, as much as it annoys me, I know there are sensible reasons behind these female-oriented categories; they just work. The truth is, women read more fiction than men, and organising fiction in understandable, relatively clear categories helps target and sell novels better. Women know what they want, and the easier you make it for them to get it, the more books you will sell. But as much as I want to be ok with this, I just can’t.

I’m going to do something tricky here - are you ready?

Bookstores have a way of categorizing and distributing their books across the shopfloor. I am of course generalising, but you usually get the product separated into two main types: Fiction and Non-Fiction. Non-Fiction will include all sorts of books, from photography catalogues to cooking recipes, books on astrophysics, economics and history, commercial non-fiction, academic books (if the bookshop caters those) and my favourite of all: dictionaries and language activity books. Yep, those are books, too!

Compared to the complex Non-Fiction multi-sections, the humble (Adult) Fiction side should be pretty straightforward. Right? Let’s take a closer look at the list (do I love lists!):

- Classics (what constitutes a classic?)
- Fantasy (what constitutes fantasy?)
- Science-fiction (no, this is not fantasy)
- Crime Fiction 
- Thriller (hehe, I honestly don’t know what that means)
- Horror
- Erotica
- Literary & Commercial Fiction (you’ll usually find these merged together under General Fiction)
- Chick-Lit (which sometimes is in the above category, and other times it isn’t)
- Romance Fiction
- YA, aka Young Adult Fiction

Here comes the tricky thing: among the categories above, you will find that two of them are _only_ targeted at women (and by only, I mean _only_, and I don’t care if you have an uncle who happens to be a rarity and reads a couple of Romance Fiction novels every week); that’s not the point. The key word here is _targeting_. Even _if_ (and I would love to see some actual data on this) Fantasy, Science-Fiction, Crime Fiction, Thriller and Horror are typically consumed by men, they are not targeted at men. In fact, editorial teams put a reasonable amount of effort into acquiring niche stories that will appeal to women. Why is that? Well, because women are great fiction consumers, of course - the more they can buy, the better. 

In recent years we’ve been trying to get women more involved with things or customs that were traditionally men-only. LEGO sells to both little boys and girls; women drink beer; women watch _Game of Thrones_. Women discover that all these are good, interesting, enjoyable - and they lose the fear to enjoy them. It becomes popular among women, and then normalised. However, I have yet to see it go the other way around. Let me know when you see Matel selling Barbies to young boys. Really, can’t wait to see that.

Are men genuinely incapable of enjoying women’s fiction, or are we all making it happen - or rather, preventing it from happening?

### The stigma

As with many other womanly things, there’s a stigma associated with women’s fiction. Women’s fiction is for _sissies_. Women’s fiction is boring, or superficial, or frivolous. Women’s fiction is not as serious as normal, regular or general fiction. Women’s fiction can never be as good. This also applies to all other niche categories; what bothers me is that women’s fiction is a niche category in itself.

It shouldn’t be that way. There shouldn’t be a distinction. To some extent, I understand the need for chick-lit and _Romance_ categories. I get that. Those are proper niches. Virginia Woolf shouldn’t be in a niche category. Jane Austen shouldn’t be in a niche category. Margaret Atwood should not be in a niche category.

Because they aren’t. It’s for the public to decide whether they are literary or not, and for time to pass before we see them become classics or not (and, yes, I’m aware that two of them have already done that). Who reads them or not, however, should not be an issue. Everyone should read them because both men and women can enjoy them equally, understand them equally, and take just as many things from them.

So what if a book revolves around the life of a woman? Are _David Copperfield_, _Stoner_, _The remains of day_ or _Ulysses_ men's fiction? 

But of course they are not. That category doesn’t even exist.
