I have been working out almost every day for the past 6 weeks. I say *almost* because sometimes I have skipped a day. Just a day. Not two days, just one. I work out for just about 30 minutes, during the weekends I do 45-60 minutes or I go for a cycle. I've never been the type of person who works out, by the way. This is not me being humble – that's just the plain truth. Ask any of my long-time friends, they will tell you how unfit I've always been. My thin build is just a happy coincidence.

I have been meditating daily for the past 78 days, in a row. I have this app that tracks my meditation sessions. Sometimes I've had to really push it, meditate right before bed, meditate while laying down, meditate for just three minutes, meditate on the tube, or at work. But I showed up for my meditation practice, every single day, for the past two and a half months.

I have also stopped cracking my knuckles. This one was hard, it's a little painful habit I've been perpetuating for the past 15 years. It started with my uncle Valter jokingly teaching me how to do it. Well, uncle Valter, I have regretted that moment of fun ever since! I just couldn't stop it, and I didn't even like the sound of it, or how sometimes it hurt. But *not* doing it seemed to hurt just as much, or more. It was all psychological, and I knew. So some weeks ago I decided I wouldn't do it any more. I made the choice, and this time around, I sticked with it.

3 days ago I re-started my *365 photos a day* project. I did this for a few months in 2014, and then again for a few months in 2015 together with my boyfriend. 2016 was a year of no photos, but I have decided to do it again in 2017, at least during the summer months, and on my own. I've made it easy for myself this time around – I'm allowed to take photos with my phone, I'm just moving any new photos to my Google Photos account so that I don't use up laptop storage and I have downloaded the Flickr & Instagram apps on my phone so that I can quickly upload them to my albums (I'm keeping my album on Flickr). I have even allowed myself to use preset filters, because they are quick, look good and, let's face it: if I'm taking a photo a day, most of them won't deserve the time you have to put in to process them manually with Photoshop.

So after doing all these little things, I thought: why not write once a day, for 30 days in a row? Why not give your writing passion a go? Huh?

So here I am. First day, and – let's just say it – going strong.
