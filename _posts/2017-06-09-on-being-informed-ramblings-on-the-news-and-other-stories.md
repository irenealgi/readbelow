Oh, being 'informed'.

Staying 'informed'.

Keeping up with the daily happenings of the world.

Knowing stuff. The stuff that matters. The important stuff.

Like, who's the current president of China. Or where is Georgia – not the state, the country. Yes, it exists. And what's the name of the river that goes across Paris, because I really need to know that, and what's up with the Kardashians this week. Or last week. And have you heard about that kid who disappeared in Portugal during the summer? Because he looked cute in the pictures and everyone in Europe is suffering alongside the family, who look somewhat suspicious but the Mom seems to be going through hell so we think it's just the Dad that was involved in the matter. And no, I've never heard that song, and I don't know what Arianna Grande looks like. I can tell Justin Bieber and Justin Timberlake apart, but don't ask me to recognise Mr Timberlake in a sea of people. Or in a room with three other attractive men of middle age. I can't even recall if the guy has dark or blond hair. Maybe he has no hair.

I've never cared, not for the so-called news, not for the gossip. Yes, I was also shocked when Angelina and Brad split up and when Donald Trump won the elections, I'm not *that* oblivious. But my knowledge is quite limited. And I don't care. I used to feel embarrassed of my lack of interest, as if it were a flaw of mine. I felt selfish, or like an idiot, or maybe both. But a couple of years ago I decided that enough was enough. So now I still don't give a damn. And I don't care.

Apparently there's research that proves that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli" target="_blank">reading the news makes people unhappy</a>, or less happy. The Guardian article claims that 'news is easy to digest', but I disagree. I find the news puzzling because whenever I try to keep up with it, I'm missing the context and I can't even understand the headlines. It's like starting to watch *Coronation Street* in the middle of season 15 – there's so much backstory you just can't follow.

<blockquote>
<p>The media feeds us small bites of trivial matter, tidbits that don't really concern our lives and don't require thinking. That's why we experience almost no saturation. Unlike reading books and long magazine articles (which require thinking), we can swallow limitless quantities of news flashes, which are bright-coloured candies for the mind.</p>
</blockquote>

Again, I disagree. I find the news absolutely saturating and overwhelming, there's just too much information, all at once. It makes me anxious and it doesn't offer me space to breathe and process all the new data. I definitely *can't* 'swallow limitless quantities of news flashes', or else I'll vomit, and that won't be fun. The article goes on to paraphrase Nassim Taleb:

<blockquote>
<p>News misleads. Take the following event (borrowed from Nassim Taleb). A car drives over a bridge, and the bridge collapses. What does the news media focus on? The car. The person in the car. Where he came from. Where he planned to go. How he experienced the crash (if he survived). But that is all irrelevant. What's relevant? The structural stability of the bridge. That's the underlying risk that has been lurking, and could lurk in other bridges. But the car is flashy, it's dramatic, it's a person (non-abstract), and it's news that's cheap to produce. <em>News leads us to walk around with the completely wrong risk map in our heads. So terrorism is over-rated. Chronic stress is under-rated. The collapse of Lehman Brothers is overrated. Fiscal irresponsibility is under-rated. Astronauts are over-rated. Nurses are under-rated.</em></p>
</blockquote>

'Nurses are under-rated'. In what sense? Probably in many. Regardless, yes, I agree with this. The focus is all wrong – but that doesn't matter. Because, and here's my point: 'the news' is not really about the news. I'll repeat in bold below:

**'The news is not really about the news.'**

A journalist is a storyteller. They are not meant to tell you the truth – whatever that means – or to inform you on the 'important stuff' – whatever *that* means. You'll notice that it's all quite subjective; we all care about different things. But the journalist is not looking to keep you 'in the know'. Their focus is on *selling*, helping the media platform *make money*. And as much as you want to care about 'fiscal irresponsibility' and 'under-rated nurses', the truth is you really don't. It's a fact. And if you don't care, you won't consume their content and they won't *sell*. So journalists are on the lookout for stories you care about, like the flashy car and the tragically dead middle-aged driver with three children and a loving wife.

And I don't care. I mean, I'm not heartless. I don't want people to die, and I'm sorry when I hear they do, but when I turn off the TV, or when I look away from the newspaper, I don't continue to think about the man who disappeared during the terrorist attack. I go on with my life because I don't know that man, and I guess I don't care about him. I wish he was sound and safe and with his family, but he's not part of my life, and my life is complicated enough as it is. Does keeping up with the news make you unhappier? I wouldn't know. I've never really followed the news, so I don't know if I'd be less happy if I did. I do know that I'm still miserable sometimes, so *not* reading the news won't save your life.

The truth is, I know people who follow the news religiously, and I know people who don't. The people who do *seem* and *sound* more knowledgeable. They can *talk* more. They can participate in discussions. Whether they can actually contribute to the discussion with opinions of their own, however, is another story. And the more you consume information curated by someone else – and especially if you always consume information from the same source – the harder it gets to hold your own opinion. Knowledge is good, but knowing how to process and make sense of such knowledge is equally important. And if you just *know* stuff but don't really understand its underlaying meaning, what does it matter?

So a while ago I stopped feeling shitty about my lack of interest in current matters, because most current matters will stop being current soon enough and will become irrelevant in no time. I much rather care about the things that have stood the test of time, events and people that have changed the course of history, the ones that belong with books and documentaries. So I read. I read fiction and non-fiction. I read about psychology, romance and history. I read and I learn, and *that* makes me more knowledgeable and – I'd like to think – a bit wiser.

This was a long one, and I didn't know where it was going, but I quite like the destination I've reached.
