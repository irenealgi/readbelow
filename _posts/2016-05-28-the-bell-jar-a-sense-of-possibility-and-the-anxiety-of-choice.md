excerpt: A review of Sylvia Plath's <i>The Bell Jar</i>
---

I'm not obsessed with Sylvia Plath's _The Bell Jar_, but I liked it. I enjoyed it. I didn't find it boring, or dull. It's got some lines of pure beauty and brilliance. I didn't adore Esther Greenwood, and I didn't _get her_; I've never been in her shoes, literally or otherwise. And yet I think it does offer some insight into what white, middle-class, young girls must have been through during the 50s and 60s in the US.

>“I was supposed to be having the time of my life.”

Sylvia Plath was one of the most remarkable poets of her time; she was also a wife - to poet Ted Hughes - and the mother of two children, Nicholas and Frieda. A lot has been said - and conjectured - about Sylvia Plath's life, her chronic depression, her internal struggles and her feminist approach, so I won't go into that. After several attempts, Plath managed to commit suicide in 1963 by sticking her head in the oven. She left two very young children behind, and she had just turned 30 herself. _The Bell Jar_ had been published a few months earlier under the pseudonym "Victoria Lucas".

I'm not used to reading biographies, fictional biographies or autobiographies. The genre in itself escapes me. I've read a couple of instances - _Z: Zelda Fitzgerald_ and _The Last Act of Love_ - but that's about it. _The Bell Jar_ is quite clearly a semi-autobiographical novel, and that made me a little bit uncomfortable. Esther is not entirely fictional, after all, but Plath's alter-ego, and reading her throughts feels like an intrusion - as a reader, you are invading her privacy. But she did leave the door open on her own account. Fortunately for me, I'm often comfortable with the uncomfortable; I don't let it get to me. So I read on.

**A sense of possibility**

“I remember one morning getting up at dawn. There was such a sense of possibility," says Meryl Streep as Clarissa Vaughan, reminiscing the old days when she was young and there was still so much for her to do, in _The Hours_. To me, it's that 'sense of possibility' that's slowly killing Esther Greenwood.

>"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."

We like to criticise the poor, white little rich girl, and I guess I can't blame the less priviledged for feeling that way. Esther can be, at times, incredibly annoying. She's beautiful, she's white, she's very bright and has earned a scholarship. At the start of the novel, she's having a blast in New York City, living in a hotel, learning the ropes as an intern at a cool fashion magazine and going to parties. Now there's a terrible way to spend the summer. She even has a boy-friend who seems to be quite fine - educated, handsome, studying to become a doctor. Yet she whines so much. She's never content. She's never happy. Nothing is ever quite right. It's hard for the contemporary reader to understand her, but that's only because many of us are wearing exactly the same shoes. And it feels uncomfortable.

>"When they asked me what I wanted to be I said I didn’t know.
>"Oh, sure you know," the photographer said.
>"She wants," said Jay Cee wittily, "to be everything."

Esther Greenwood wants to be everything, and that's only because she knows she _could_ be anything. Yet she can't be _everything_. She can't be a writer, and an editor, and an astronaut, and a loving housewife and mother at the same time. There is such a sense of possibility, and yet _that's_ not a possibility. She must make a choice.

> Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?
―_The Little Mermaid_

I know that _The Bell Jar_ has been regarded as a feminist text, and I really didn't want to go down that road, but it's hard because the road is there, right in front of me, and it looks so inviting. So I'm taking it - yet only half-way through.   

Ariel in _The Little Mermaid_ must decide whether she wants to stay with her family or live on land with her prince. As we can see in the sequel, she chose to live with her prince, and had to let go of her family under the sea. My point here is: no one ever went to Prince Eric and asked him whether he would enjoy spending some time underwater as a male mermaid. That never happened. In the sixties, no man was ever approached and asked to consider becoming a stay-at-home dad so that his wife could pursue her astronaut career. _That_ never happened.

>"So I began to think maybe it was true that when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterward you went about as numb as a slave in a totalitarian state."

It was a time when women began to slowly earn the right to choose. They had options. Up to that point, their only option had been to marry and have kids, and be at the expense of their husbands, but come the sixties and suddenly it feels like they could do _so much more._ As long as they didn't have a family. A woman could be a housewife or a magazine editor, but she couldn't be both. Men didn't have to choose because - arguably - they didn't have a choice. They can't give birth, so even if they _can_ take care of the baby after it is born, they can't actually have the baby. There's no path to choose. As women are allowed to enter the male world, however, the need to decide what to devote one's life to becomes apparent.

>“When you choose one way out of many, all the ways you don't take are snuffed out like candles, as if they'd never existed.”
― Philip Pullman, The Amber Spyglass

So Esther Greenwood, beautiful and with a bright future ahead of her, is scared to death. She must make a choice, but the problem with making the call is that you could be making the bad call - and then it's all on you. Choice goes hand in hand with responsibility, and responsibility is one scary thing. The nineteenth century saw the majority of the population being stuck with their reality and their day-to-day routine - put simply, born a farmer, died a farmer. A farmer wouldn't be thinking what else to do with his life, his wife wouldn't be considering her other options as she looked after five healthy kids and a dying baby. That was it. For most people, life was what it was. There was no way out, and there was no wondering, no pondering, no thinking.

>“You can have peace. Or you can have freedom. Don't ever count on having both at once.”
― Robert A. Heinlein

We could argue that spare time is a problem for most people living in Western societies, and this applies to both women and men.

>“If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I'm neurotic as hell. I'll be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days.”

In his _The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less_, psychologist Barry Schwartz says that “What we don’t realize is that the very option of being allowed to change our minds seems to increase the chances that we will change our minds.” He also argues that the more choice we have, the worse of a problem it becomes, but I wouldn't necessarily agree with him on that point. I like the fact that there is so much choice, so much possibility, ahead of us in the Western world. I just think no one - or hardly any one - has taught us how to choose the right options.

Poor Esther Greenwood, with all her whiteness, and her riches, and her beauty and her brightness, has no freaking idea what to do with her life. And that _is_ a real problem.

**A sense of doom**

You can't discuss _The Bell Jar_ and get away with not discussing depression, but I much prefer a sense of possibility to a sense of doom, so I'll get this section through quickly before _I_ become depressed.

>“I couldn’t see the point of getting up. I had nothing to look forward to.”

Put simply, the amount of detail Plath gives to Esther's thoughts is extraordinary. It feels real. It goes into the mind of a chronically depressed person, someone who is sad for no apparent and justifiable reason, and you _almost_ understand her. Throughout the first part of the novel, Esther comes across as someone who is permanently not very happy, but not particularly sad either. She doesn't laugh or have much fun, but seems to be doing just fine, making friends, going to college, dating and dreaming of becoming a journalist or a writer. She's a little bit ackward and feels many times alienated from her peers, but she seems to be coping.

>“I am sure there are things that can't be cured by a good bath but I can't think of one.”

And then her condition slowly deteriorates. She comes down with food poisoning and is forced to stay in bed for a couple of days, then the end of her internship is looming and she goes to this party where a guy tries to force her into having sex with him - but doesn't succeed - and, finally, once back home she finds out she's been rejected by the organiser of a writing course she was hoping to join after her New York City experience.

>"If you expect nothing from somebody you are never disappointed."

To be fair, none of these are much of a big deal, but put together, one after the other, the events sort of explain why Esther would spiral down into a depression. She's disappointed and upset.

>“I felt myself melting into the shadows like the negative of a person I'd never seen before in my life.”

And there it comes, it's happening.

>“The floor seemed wonderfully solid. It was comforting to know I had fallen and could fall no farther.”

Until she hits bottom. And then, once again, Plath's characher - and Plath herself - has to make a choice. Live. Or die.

>“But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrist looked so white and defensless that I couldn't do it. It was as if what I wanted to kill wasn't in that skin or the thin blue pulse that jumped under my thumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, and a whole lot harder to get.”

I have spoiled much of this novel already, but I won't spoil its ending - which is somehow open to interpretation, anyway. I would say that, even if very subtly, both Esther and Sylvia eventually made their call. Whether they made the same call or not, however, is for the reader to decide.
