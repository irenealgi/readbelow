Last night I had a thought. There's nothing peculiar about that – I have thoughts _all the time_. Thinking is like breathing; you just can't stop it. But this thought was different, this thought was worth thinking about. Here's what I thought:

> What I think _matters_. It matters to me, but it could also matter to someone else. I'm no nobody. The fact that I am _someone_ makes me someone. 

It's taken me a while to figure this one out, but that's ok. I mean, we're all different, some of us need more time than others. It's taken me twenty-nine years to learn that what I think – what anyone thinks –matters, but the important thing here is that I found out before dying, so now I can do something about it. I can share my thoughts now, and maybe you'll find them useful – maybe you have a completely different view on this or that, maybe you'd never thought of it in the first place. Please share _your_ thoughts with me – they matter, too.

Let's start. Like, now.

I think I should think differently. No, wait – I think I _want_ to think differently. In fact, I think the word _should_ should indeed be vanished from my vocabulary. It's constrincting, it makes me feel obliged to do or avoid doing something. And, what's worse – it fills me up with guilt when I don't follow. So it's not about what I should do or shouldn't do – it's about what I _want_ to do. I want to think differently because I think it will make me happier, and I want to be happier. 

I think I want to eat differently – you see where I'm going with this, right? I want to eat in a way that nurtures my body, not because that's what I'm supposed to do, but because that's what I deserve.

I think I want to do things I enjoy. Like writing this post! Like working on a novel. Like singing for my loved ones, or dancing –– quite awfully – to that ABBA song. Like reading a book and talking about it. Like making love, eating chocolate cake and cycling in the park. 

I think I want to work in something that helps me grow. It doesn't matter as much whether it's _what I've studied for_. Because, if I _think_ about it, I have studied to be the person I am. Everything I've done, in fact, makes me the person I am and continues to build the person I'll be. I did English at university, and I did a Masters in Publishing, but now I work in Marketing and I always apologise for that. No more. I continue to enjoy XIXth century literature and my degree in English has helped me become an observant reader. Useful or not, I'm able to identify the different publishers in the UK and Spain today, and that's just another fun fact about myself – and it makes me absurdly happy to have that kind of knowledge and share it with others. 

And I also like my job. I actually love it. And it's not in _what_ I do that I find the kind of pleasure I'm looking for – it's in the _way_ I do it. It's in the challenge, it's in the fact that I'm constantly learning, it's in how every day I realise what things I value in a job – and which things I could do without. 

I think I want to be happy with who I am. Every day, every minute of it. I want to be able to embrace uncertainty, I want to feel comfortable in my own skin, I want to be consequent with my choices. I want to own my life to the extent to which this is possible, and I want to be ok with the many bits I have no control over. I want that kind of peace with myself.

So, this is what I want to do in order to get there. I'll read the sort of books that discuss the lifestyle I'm striving for, and I'll listen to the people who support it. I'll work towards my goals because it's in _my_ best interest. Not my family's, not my partner's or my company's. My own. This is all about me, but I know it will also affect others. My happiness and well-being will positively affect those who surround me, and that only makes these changes worthier of my time and energy.


I think many things, and I could spend all day writing them down and post a really long article about myself, but I choose not to do that because I don't think _that_ would be useful to you. I'll keep those to myself instead. They will be of use to me. 

I want you to think about what will be of use to you. What do you want, what do you truly want for youself? Look closely at your life and figure out what is it about it that makes you happy – and what doesn't. Then, it's all about _wanting_ to change. Want it for yourself, want it because it will do you good, and the chances you'll get there will increase exponentially. I'm on that same road with you. I _want_ to change myself.
