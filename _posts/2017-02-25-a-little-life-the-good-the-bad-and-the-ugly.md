Let’s face it: there’s nothing little, or small, about *A Little Life*. Some have called it a magnificent masterpiece while others complain about how it’s overwrought and trying too hard to impress. Some have cried several times while reading, deeply sympathising with its characters, even to the point of thinking of them as real people they’ve been watching from afar, and have experienced this novel in such a way that it has transcended the realm of fiction and touched them in all the sensitive places. It’s also a triggering book, one that makes you think of other people you know or yourself. Yet others have found its plot and characters too exaggerated and melodramatic, manipulative and impossible to believe. 

*A Little Life* is a divisive read for most due to the themes it touches upon: sexual abuse in childhood, trauma, self-loathing and physical endurance. How much can one person bear? And yet *A Little Life* is also a novel about friendship, unconditional love and kindness. It’s a book filled with binaries, with blacks and whites and goodies and baddies. No shades of grey here; there’s only heros and villains. 

*A Little Life* is a somewhat plotless, character-driven novel. It’s narrated from different points of view, all of them told from the perspective of a third-person narrator except for one character who has the privilege to tell it from his own point of view. It spans across three decades, following a group of four friends from their college years up to their fifties. Even though it starts off by giving equal protagonism to our four male characters, JB, Malcom, Willem and Jude, it is soon clear that the novel is going to focus on the last two and, as it advances, Malcom and JB fall behind and into the oblivion. One hundred pages in, and you realise you’ve been invited to a different party: you are here to listen, breathe and feel the sorrows of Jude St. Francis, the mysterious friend no one knows much about. As the book delves into the main character’s past, we are presented with a collection of flashbacks that aim to tell the story which Jude’s unable to express. 

I usually don’t make lists about what I liked and what I didn’t like about a book – or anything else, really – but I’ll do that now, because I can’t think of a better way to summarise *A Little Life* than by creating two lists that showcase both my love and my hatred for this book.

### Things I Liked About _A Little Life_

**Character Development**

Some people say that the characters are underdeveloped and flat, and that can be true at times – as I said previously, it’s a novel about binaries, yet in real life everything and everyone fall among various shades of grey –, but for the most part I believed them and I thought of them as real people. Jude in particular, with all his goodness but also his selfishness, is really well written. Now that I think about it, he’s probably the only grey character in the entire novel: he’s mostly a good person, but he’s also incredibly flawed (whether he has the *right* to be flawed is another story).

**The Focus on Friendship**

>"Wasn’t friendship its own miracle, the finding of another person who made the entire lonely world seem somehow less lonely?" 

*A Little Life* begins exploring the intricacies of friendship between four characters, but soon moves its focus to the relationship between Willem and Jude. Regardless of its main focus, the majority of the characters in this book are linked to each other in terms of friendship. Willem, Malcom and JB are Jude’s best friends. Andy, Jude’s lifelong doctor, is also one of his best friends. The neighbour, Richard, is also an increasingly close friend of Jude’s. Harold, who later becomes Jude’s adoptive father, starts out as a professor, then mentor, then, finally, a friend who invites him over for dinner. While there is some coupling and some romantic love in *A Little Life*, there’s hardly no space left for that sort of relationship: *A Little Life* is a novel about friendship and, to a lesser extent, family, in all its complexity.

**The Writing is Good**

>"It is also then that I wish I believed in some sort of life after life, that in another universe, maybe on a small red planet where we have not legs but tails, where we paddle through the atmosphere like seals, where the air itself is sustenance, composed of trillions of molecules of protein and sugar and all one has to do is open one's mouth and inhale in order to remain alive and healthy, maybe you two are there together, floating through the climate. Or maybe he is closer still: maybe he is that gray cat that has begun to sit outside our neighbor's house, purring when I reach out my hand to it; maybe he is that new puppy I see tugging at the end of my other neighbor's leash; maybe he is that toddler I saw running through the square a few months ago, shrieking with joy, his parents huffing after him; maybe he is that flower that suddenly bloomed on the rhododendron bush I thought had died long ago; maybe he is that cloud, that wave, that rain, that mist. It isn't only that he died, or how he died; it is what he died believing. And so I try to be kind to everything I see, and in everything I see, I see him." 

While *A Little Life* is not the best novel I’ve ever read in terms of writing, it’s not badly written either. Yanagihara shows a good domain of the English language, and is often quite subtle about it, not letting her passion for language and writing – nor her ego – take over the story. The novel is packed with beautiful passages and interesting metaphors, and even though some found it was trying too hard to impress – in other words, it was overwritten – it didn’t feel that way to me. It was fine.

I also found some of his paragraphs very insightful, delving into the power of human relationships and the beauty of love – all sorts of love. 

**A Slow Page-Turner**

It sounds like a contradiction, and it is, but as bleak – and dull – as *A Little Life* is, every day I went back to reading a few pages, and I did so with gladness. I wouldn’t go as far as to say that I couldn’t put it down, as that’s very rare these days (at least with my reading choices), but I didn’t have to force myself to read – and, yes, I do have to do that sometimes. *A Little Life* is a strangely enjoyable read for many, probably due to all the mystery that surrounds Jude during the first half, and the way his backstory is covered – *uncovered* – in little chunks throughout. By the time you know most of what’s happened to him, you’re too invested in the whole thing to call it quits.

**A Beautiful, Dark Dickensian Novel**

>"As he gets older, he is given, increasingly, to thinking of his life as a series of retrospectives, assessing each season as it passes as if it’s a vintage of wine, dividing years he’s just lived into historical eras: The Ambitious Years. The Insecure Years. The Glory Years. The Delusional Years. The Hopeful Years." 

Yanagahara has said in numerous occasions that she was not planning on making her story believable, but rather she aimed to test the limits of what a person, and a human body, could actually handle. She succeeds in her telling of this story, a tale of rags-and-riches that watches a young man with literally nothing – no family, hardly no education, no self-esteem and no money – turn into a successful lawyer.

### Things I didn’t like about _A Little Life_

**It’s All Villains**

>"Fair" is never an answer, I would tell them. But it is always a consideration."

Jude St. Francis is abandoned soon after being born, and welcomed to a monastery where he is brought up by a group of monks whom he refers to as "brothers". A few years later, they start abusing him, both physically and sexually. No one says a thing. Several are involved. This goes on for a few years.

But there’s this special brother, Luke, who is kind to him, treats him well and gives him little presents. Brother Luke eventually convinces Jude to escape with him, and they do. We soon find out that he’s been grooming him, and Jude ends up prostituting himself as well as being forced to have sex with Brother Luke. He never hits him though, or lets others do that to him. 

Eventually Brother Luke – after a couple of years, maybe three – is found out by the police and kills himself, leaving Jude behind and in the hands of social services. You would think this would be the end of it – well, you’d think wrong. Apparently there are lots of child abusers within social services, too, and they take advantage of Jude during his stay at the home. He’s not the only victim though – apparently it’s a thing many male social workers do. 

That’s ok, he eventually escapes again. And he hitchhikes his way to nowhere, as you do. And somehow he – a sixteen years old – only gets picked up by child molesters. Jude never comes across a woman – or a man who is not a child molester, for that matter. It just doesn’t happen. So he does what he knows how to do best – he sells his body. Until he becomes ill with a sexually transmitted disease, which is when he collapses on the pavement of some road or petrol station or something like that and is kidnapped by a crazy man who calls himself a doctor and who has a cellar, because that’s just life. Eventually the doctor becomes fed up with Jude and has him run in front of his car for a very long time until the boy is so tired he falls, and then the kidnapper runs him over. Just like that. Then Jude ends up in hospital and a woman finally gives him a hand. Thank God. She’s our first angel.

**It’s All Heros**

Ana, the social worker who not long after meeting Jude dies of cancer, is our first angel, but she’s not the last. There’s also the professor who adopts Jude by the time he’s 30, the awesome friends who love and cherish him so very much, the neighbour who also looks after Jude and becomes a dear friend of his and the most extraordinary, committed and dedicated doctor in the history of fiction – or, just the history of the world.

I mean, there’s as much unconditional love in *A Little Life* as there is unacceptable levels of hatred and despair. It’s a novel of extremes.

And it borders on unrealistic. Or unbelievable. As a reader, I need to *believe* the story you’re telling me – if you don’t get me to believe, you’ve lost me. I didn’t buy the extremes in *A Little Life*, and cinism took over my experience. Yanagihara lost me there. She just did.

**Things Happen for No Reason**

>"Fairness is for happy people, for people who have been lucky enough to have lived a life defined more by certainties than by ambiguities. Right and wrong, however, are for—well, not unhappy people, maybe, but scarred people; scared people."

I get it. Real life is like that. Real life kind of sucks, and people die in car accidents and people become famous and rich and people are raped and abused, and all of this for no apparent reason. 

Yet in fiction, I kind of like it when things happen for a reason. It gives coherence to a story and it allows for that extraordinary experience that is *hindsight*. Even real life allows for that! In *A Little Life* there’s no place for hindsight – heterosexual friends fall in love with friends of their same sex and switch sexual orientation. Evil people abuse children systematically. Good people are saints who will give their all for other human beings because they are awesome. Characters become the best actors, painters, lawyers or architects in the world – because that’s just life.

>You see, Jude, in life, sometimes nice things happen to good people. You don’t need to worry—they don’t happen as often as they should. But when they do, it’s up to the good people to just say ‘thank you,’ and move on, and maybe consider that the person who’s doing the nice thing gets a bang out of it as well, and really isn’t in the mood to hear all the reasons that the person for whom he’s done the nice thing doesn’t think he deserves it or isn’t worthy of it." 

And then people die in car accidents so that you, the reader, can cry your eyes out and feel anger and despair because nothing makes sense, not even in fiction, and life sucks. Why?

**Where Are The Women?**

>"I admired how she knew, well before I did, that the point of a child is not what you hope he will accomplish in your name but the pleasure that he will bring you, whatever form it comes in, even if it is a form that is barely recognizable as pleasure at all - and more important, the pleasure you will be privileged to bring him." 

Like, where? Where? 

This book would fail the Bechdel test miserably. I wish I could expand on the quality of female characters in *A Little Life* – given that I can’t comment on the quantity – but, I think there’s only three or four female characters *in the entire novel* and they are all wives except for the social worker, who is a lesbian so I guess that makes her less of a woman (?), hence why she’s given a few lines. Not many lines though, just a few – I mean, she still owns a vagina, for God’s sake!

**Why So Long?**

*A Little Life* would have been a lot better if they’d taken it down to 300-400 pages long. At 720 pages, this novel feels long and dragging – there’s only so much pain one can take, and the same thing keeps happening over and over. I mean, I know that’s kind of how life is, but given that the rest of the book is far from realistic, I wonder why keep one of the things that makes life boring for the majority of us – repetitiveness. 

* Jude is sexually abused by many different people.

* Jude is in pain. Regularly. And we’re reminded that he’s in pain. Regularly.

* Jude is depressed. Several times. He wishes to die. Again, and again. He tries to kill himself. Several times. And everyone goes through the whole thing. Several times.

* Jude feels bad about himself, several times.

* Jude wins cases and proves to be an excellent lawyer – pain or not pain, sleep or lack of sleep, well fed or not, the man always makes a good case. He never fails. Because he’s superhuman. 

* JB, the artist, comes up with several series of paintings through the years, all of them focusing on his college friends, mostly Jude. Because Jude is awesome even if he can’t see that. Rinse and repeat several times. JB is an experienced painter – by this I mean he actually travels, meets all sorts of people, experiements with all sorts of things – who always comes back to the same themes, because otherwise he would actually be a cool, believable character.  

<br />
### FINAL THOUGHTS

I liked *A Little Life*. I know it’s got its shortcomings, but I can also find a lot of value in it. And I think it’s worth giving it a go if you are able to deal with the themes – if you’re especially sensitive to topics such as pedophilia, sexual abuse, suicidal thinking, self-harming and homosexuality, I suggest you stay away from this book. If you think these won’t pose a problem, however, go ahead and read it. It will touch in a way few novels do.
