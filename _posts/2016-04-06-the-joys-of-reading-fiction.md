I was by no means the brightest child in my class, but my parents claim I mastered two things before anyone else in my year: shoe-lacing and reading. Apparently I was tying my friend's shoes by the age of three, and could read at normal speed by the age of seven. Since 80% of the shoes in my rather impressive collection _have_ laces, and books have been my favourite companions for almost three decades, I'd say my much younger self was onto something here.

The first novel I ever read on my own was one I already knew about, as my mother had read it to me aloud before. It was a lovely story about the <a href="https://www.amazon.es/lluna-fill-Barco-Vapor-Azul/dp/8476296770/277-2040750-0621726?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0" target="_blank">Moon wanting to have a child </a>. Yes, only those able to read in Catalan will be able to enjoy it - I'm genuinely sorry. I don't know what I liked so much about it - certainly it wasn't my desire to have children! - but that little book has stuck to me like no other. I was six.

I loved reading from the start, and to this day I don't know if I enjoyed it because the ability came with ease or if I found it so easy because I enjoyed it and it was worth the effort. Regardless, I read, and read, and read, and when I was eight or nine I began to write. Short stories. Longer stories. But that's another story altogether.

Reading started as a form of escapism, of pure entertainment, and it was so for years. I think I began to read for enlightment quite late - I must have been fifteen or sixteen when I first grabbed _a difficult book_. 

**On difficult books**

Difficult books are those you struggle with in some way. You may struggle with them because they are hard to make sense of, or because they are good, but some passages could make you die of boredom. _Anna Karenina_, anyone? Difficult books often feature complex language, or grammar, or structure, or themes. Sometimes they are complex in so many ways that you have to put them aside and get back to them when you feel ready to take on the challenge.

But the beauty of difficult books - and the reason I enjoy a difficult book - is precisely that they _are_ challenging and, therefore, they change you in some way and, by the time you reach their ending, they've made you better. 

Difficult books can be a nightmare, but they can also be rewarding. Just like most things in life, when you spent a good amount of effort (and often time) on doing something, reaching your goal is a lot more satisfying. Think about it; cooking a fantastic new dish in which you invested your entire morning in the kitchen, writing a novel that's taken you three years and a lot of sweating and going back and forth, losing a good amount of weight (healthily, steadily) and managing to change your eating habits along the way. All these accomplishments are a lot more rewarding if you put a lot of effort in them - it's _those_ things you can't take for granted.

It's the same with _difficult books_ - if you go for the easy pick, you may be able to read faster (and probably more), but you'll feel emptier because, well, they didn't take much effort, and they didn't challenge you in any way. It's like reading the same story over and over, like having a degree in Biology and reading Year 8 books on Natural Sciences. It's pointless and, frankly, very boring. If you like reading, go for it. Take the challenge. Ryan Holiday wrote about <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/04/read-to-lead-how-to-digest-books-above-your-level/" target="_blank" >reading above your level in order to lead </a>, but he was talking mostly about non-fiction. I'm mostly a fiction reader, so here's why I think you should read _Ulysses_ (or whatever your nemesis is).

**Fiction enables learning through beauty and entertainment**

Reading fiction is a great way to learn about stuff, from history to medical treatments, politics, philosophy or religion, to name a few general topics I've read about on several occasions and thanks to several books. There are so many things I've learned while readings novels! Trivia and anecdotes are the best.

**Fiction improves your ability to sympathise**

There's proof that <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/" target="_blank">fiction readers tend to be more sensitive</a>, and even if there weren't, that's something I have suspected for a long time. I have always read a lot, and it's always been fiction (until now, that is!). And I've been praised a few times on my ability to understand others, to see where others are coming from. Yep, it's all in the books. 

**Fiction improves your ability to consider facts and foresee the consequences**

Sometimes we forget that fiction is based on real life. Even fantasy fiction has been imagined up and written by a human living on this planet, _now_. So no matter how strange their plots may seem, they still follow the logics of the world. Just like in fiction, you can never know for certain, but just like when you are reading fiction, you can take a wild guess - and just like when you are reading fiction, more often than not your guessing will be spot on. 

Our ability to understand and foresee the consequences of what's happening in the present is the result of experience: the first time the child gets hurt after jumping off a chair, he's taken aback - and cries, more because he's shocked and scared rathen than due to the pain. The second time - or maybe the tenth time - the child jumps off a chair, he knows what may happen. He knows he _may_ get hurt. He also knows that there's a change he may _not_ get hurt, which is why we often make the same mistakes over and over. 

The more fiction you read, the more experiences you learn about. It's like hearing about your neighbour having lung cancer after forty years of smoking, but multiplied by x1000. You get to read a lot about people making mistakes, and sometimes you may even learn from them .

**Fiction pumps your capacity to imagine**

There's a reason why every time a film adaptation comes up some readers respond to it furiously. When a reader grabs an unabridged text, it's just the original story and them. The author has written a story which they are reading and interpreting as they feel, as it speaks to _them_. But because each of us has a different experience based on our knowledge, understanding and perception of the world, each of us reads the same story differently.

A film adaptation is just another reading of a story, someone else's interpretation - the film director's, the actors, even the make up artists. They usually involve many people, but not the reader. So when someone spots Emma Watson and claims she makes _the perfect Hermione Granger_, the reader feels cheated. Because that's not how _they_ imagined her to be.

We live in a world where little is left to the imagination - from clear images of far away wars to TV shows featuring forensic doctors and porn (sometimes mixed, probably) -, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it's ruining our ability to imagine _things_. Last time I checked, _imagining_ and _creating_ went hand in hand. If we lose our ability to imagine, we lose our ability to create new things. We lose our ability to move forward.

**Fiction improves your use of language**

Reading non-fiction is good for improving your general vocabulary and mastering grammar, but nothing - or no one - teaches new words like Vladimir Nabokov (who, funnily enough, didn't write in his mother tongue). The purpose of non-fiction writing - especially in commercial non-fiction - is to clearly inform and make a point. _Clearly_. As simply as possible.

Can you imagine if James Joyce had woken up one day and said, _'Hah, I'll re-write Ulyssess, but I'll make it simple this time around!_' Some of you may think that'd be worth celebrating, and I won't contradict you because I haven't even gathered the courage to read that. Yet. 

But my point is that _Ulysses_ made simple wouldn't be _Ulysses_'. It'd be the story of one man's day in Dublin. _Mrs Dalloway_ made simple could be told in a couple of lines: 'That day she was having a party. She finished prepping the party. She hosted a party. Her exboyfriend showed up at the door, and she remembered her youth. Eventually, people left'. No one wants to read that, even if takes just half a page. 

The joy of literature is that fiction writers play with words, grammar, language. And when you read them, you learn. Like when I learned came across the word <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/granoblastic" target="_blank">_granoblastically_</a> on _Ada or Ardor_, and looked it up on the dictionary, and wondered whether it was a real word at all, and it was. And to this day I haven't had the chance to use it, but I still remember it, fresh and ready to go. 

**Fiction - and reading in general - teaches long-term focus**

And with this one I finish.

Newspapers are getting thinner, articles snappier. Facebook doesn't favour long-form, and Twitter forces you to write under 140 characters. We consume Buzzfeed and Snapshat; Instagram is mostly images and hashtags, maybe meaninful but free of any sense of grammar. 

We are able to hold several conversations at once via Whatsapp and I think twice before comitting to the two and a half hours I will need in order to reach the ending - I might as well watch a 45'-long episode. 

We are losing our ability to work on something, enjoy something, do something for a long period of time. Read books because they usually take more than a day. Read books because they will teach you to come back.

If I haven't lost you by this point, kudos to you for being this strong. Thank you for your precious time, which you have invested in reading this instead of choosing to do any of the many other things available to you. Thanks for not giving in, for not letting all that external input get at you, and distract you from the task of reading this blog.

That's one other thing I've learned from reading. You can slow down. You can enjoy the ride - quite literally, many times on a commute. You can even extend that ride so that the pleasure of reading lasts longer. Like when you pick a longer commute so that you can spend more quality time reading, because it's only on the tube - with no WIFI - that you are able to focus on that.

Don't look at me like this. I know I'm not the only one.
