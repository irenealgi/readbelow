Today I wanted to write about one of my favourite students – we'll call her Anna.

I met Anna online, on a platform where tutors and students could connect and agree to meet face to face. Anna was 19 at the time, in her first year of Uni. She was studying Journalism at a private college and she needed English classes because her level was quite poor and she couldn't follow her English lectures, so she felt she needed the extra support.

I hadn't seen any photos of her, so I didn't know what to expect while I waited sitting on a bench for her to come fetch me at the tube station. As she approached me, I thought 'oh God, she's posh'. She lived in a humble, working-class neighbourhood, and I didn't expect my new student to be this pretty girl with the perfect outfit and gracious blond, long straight hair. She also looked even younger than she was. And I judged her. I just did. You would have, too.

Anna was not a quick student. I'm not being mean here: she just wasn't. She wasn't an intelligent person, or not intelligent in the way most people understand the adjective. But all the brightness she supposedly lacked, she made up for with her self-awareness and sensibility.

<blockquote>
<p>I know I'm not very bright, she told me one day. Even in high school, it took me twice the time to learn and understand things. If I wanted to get grades as good as my classmates', I had to study twice as much. And twice as hard. So that's what I do. I put in the extra hours and the extra effort, and that way I can get to the same place.</p>
</blockquote>

She was nineteen. She was not being self-deprecating, or humble, or putting herself down. She was stating a fact: 'many other people are brighter than me'. But instead of endlessly whining and feeling sorry for herself, she was proactive. She was realistic, but she was also an optimist. She spotted a weakness she had, and worked hard in order to fix it.

They call this grit, or resilience. But I think there's more to it than that. You see, it's easy to beat yourself up for things you can't do, have done or are not. It's also relatively easy to think of yourself as superhuman, covering your eyes before any evidence of your flawed nature. The hard thing to do is to honestly acknowledge your strengths and your shortcomings, and *then* to tell yourself:

<blockquote>
<p>Cool, so this is what we've got to work with. So let's get to it. Let's do the work.</p>
</blockquote>

It turns out Anna was one of the brightest people I've ever met, because she had a very clear idea of what she wanted (to be a journalist, to be with her boyfriend in a happy relationship and live together in an apartment of their own, to be happy) and she figured out a way to get there *despite* her shortcomings. She knew she was pretty, she knew she was good-natured and easy to get along with, she also knew she was shy and she knew she was not the smartest, but it was ok. She knew herself, and she was ready to work with whatever God, luck, chance, coincidence or life would throw her way.
