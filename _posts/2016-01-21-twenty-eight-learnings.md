1. Honesty does not equal unkindness. Be sincere, offer healthy and helpful criticism, but always be kind.
2. Stick up for yourself but also stick up for others, especially your children, your more vulnerable friends and your family. Be strong when others can't. I've been the friend and the child others stuck up for, and I'm very, very grateful for that.
3. It's fine to be demanding of others, as long as you are just as demanding (or more!) of yourself.
4. Expect as little from others as you can. That way, you'll always be positively surprised.
5. Be understanding and sympathetic. Try to put on the other's shoes even if they don't fit you. You'll see they probably don't fit them, either.
6. If you are a woman, respect other women. Don't use mysoginistic words like bitch to refer to them. Don't criticise their appearance, or judge them by their looks.
7. Admire others and let them know. Give compliments. Compliments are always good.
8. Say 'thank you' and genuinely mean it.
9. Get your life a soundtrack. Find the right tune for the right mood.
10. Bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people. There's not much you can do about it. Good things happen to good people, too.
11. If it doesn't work, fix it. If it doesn't work again, find an alternative.
12. They say you should do what you love, and do it often. I'd tweak that a little bit and say that, as hard as it is, you should try to enjoy everything you do.
13. Take up a hobby and make it a passion. Repeat.
14. Traveling as a tourist is probably overrated. Living someplace new is an incredible learning experience.
15. Be consequent with your decisions. Admit to your own faults but don't dwell on them. Learn from your mistakes and move on.
16. If you really want something, and you move towards that goal, there's a good chance you'll get it.
17. Romance is overrated. Love is not.
18. The comfort zone is a dangerous place to be in.
19. You're beautiful in your own way. It's not a clich√©; it's the truth.
20. You don't always need to have an opinion on things you know not much about. Listen to as many people as you can discussing the same matter. Consider and make up your own mind, if you want.
21. Read. Read widely, read wisely and read well.
22. Treat yourself.
23. Have a journal and use it to record your experiences, thought-processing, doodling and what have you.
24. Look. Look around. Look above. Look below. See.
25. They might be wrong. You might be wrong.
26. Sometimes it is impossible, but most often it's not.
27. The truth is, they are probably not talking about you. Honestly, you're really not that important.
28. It's probably not a big deal.
