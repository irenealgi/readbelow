Not really, but I couldn't think of a better title. Because sleepiness does kill *my* creativity. And my energy levels are low.

Today I went to Bletchley Park, which is where Alan Turing designed the machine that would decipher Enigma, but I'm going to write about this some other time because I'm tired and I can't put two and two together, right now. Which, by the way, is a funny expression. Putting two and two together. Hah. Anyway.

I'm not sure what to write about, my eyelids are about to close and I'm lying on the bed, which does not help. I should have thought about that before bringing the laptop into my bedroom. Yep, that was not the best idea I've had today.

Oh God, I'm really falling asleep. Like, really. I just closed my eyes, and now I'm tuping(typing) with my eyes closed, and I'm really sorry if this doesn't make sense, but that's just a representation of lide(life), I guess. Whoa, that wasn't too bad. You can almost read and understand the whole thing. Now I know that I can type even if I become blind. Although I hope that doesn't happen.

Ok, I'm going to bed, there's no point in killing myself over this. I will probably delete this one when this 30-days thing is over. Three more weeks to go.
