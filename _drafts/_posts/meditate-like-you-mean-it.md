>Have you considered meditation?

Someone at work asked me one day. No, I had never considered meditation. Meditating was this weird thing some people did, the sort of people who do yoga and pilates, and quit eating meat. Vegans and quinoa fans. I don't know. I wasn't any of those things. I was normal.

But my normality had gone out of the window a few weeks before, and I was crying a lot and getting really upset over things that were not in my power to change. Things from the past. Things that did not even have anything to do with me in the first place, for God's sake. I knew it made no sense whatsoever, but man did it hurt. It hurt a lot. It still hurts, to be honest. It turned out I suffer from anxiety. Whatever I thought 'normal' meant, I wasn't part of that group. I was not normal. I was in trouble.
