Hi, I'm Irene. 

Born in Spain, I've been living in London for the past two years. I like it here. It's not perfect, but what is? It's a powerful city, truly full of opportunities - if you know how and where to find them.

I did English at university and an MA in Publishing. I've done my fair share of assisting publishers, copywriting books on interiorism and freelancing. I even worked as a barista!  

Now I'm the Content Editor and Community Manager at <a href="https://onfido.com/" target="_blank">Onfido</a>. I kind of love it.

But most of all, I love reading and writing. Always have, always will. 

Stuff I read and write about:

- Books & Litearature
- Writing & Fiction
- Publishing
- Photography
- Lifestyle(s)
- Startups & Tech
