Irene, 28, born in Spain, living in hectic London.

Studied English, did an MA in Publishing, wanted to work as an editor, ended up
working as a content editor for a tech startup and learning all sorts of stuff
on marketing, technology, startups, business and social media.

Interests include books, literature, writing, photography, The Internet, and
turning my Windows 10 PC into a tool I can actually work with.

I also like drinking coffee; making it, not so much.
