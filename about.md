My name is Irene. Born in Spain, I've been living in London for the past two years. I like it here. It's not perfect, but what is? It's a powerful city, truly full of opportunities - if you know how and where to find them.

I did English at university. I know, not very original, but being Spanish I'm hoping it'll give me a couple of brownie points. Then I went on to do an MA in Publishing, which _is_ original and very niche, just not very useful. 

I did my fair share of assisting publishers, copywriting books on interiorism - someone had to do it - and freelancing. I also worked as a barista when I first arrived in London; it paid the rent and showed me that I _can_ work with my hands - I'm just not very good at it. 

Now I work as a Content Editor and Community Manager for a London tech startup. I kind of love it.

But most of all, I love reading and writing. Always have, always will. 

Stuff I read and write about:

- Books & Litearature
- Writing & Fiction
- Publishing
- Photography
- Lifestyle(s)
- Startups & Tech 

I don't write about these, but also love them: my partner, my family, my friends, my cat and my cup of coffee. Nah, scratch that. _Not_ my cat.
