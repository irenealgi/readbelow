Irene, 28, born in Spain, living in hectic London.

Studied English, did an MA in Publishing, wanted to work as an editor, ended up
working as a content editor for a tech startup and learning all sorts of stuff
on marketing, technology, startups, business and social media.

Interests include books, literature, writing, photography and The Internet.

I also like drinking coffee; making it, not so much.
